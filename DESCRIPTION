Description: The ribiosDemo package provides prototypes and examples demonstrating how to call APIs defined by the BIOS system from R. We hope this package assists programmers new to BIOS and/or to R to establish crosstalks between two systems. Whoever interested is welcomed to study the source code and make contributions.
