Version 1.1-2 (Apr 11, 2014)
  + Bug fix in matchGenes and geneCounts.

Version 1.1-1 (Apr 07, 2014)
  + parseGSEA functions are added to parse all relevant information from a GSEA output directory
  + gsName, gsDesc, and gsGenes are harmonized for both GSEA results parsing and general GMT file parsing
  + Classes and methods are added to handle gene sets and GSEA results

Version 1.0-9 (Dec 02, 2013)
  + Variables such as GSEA_GENESET_DIR are exported.

Version 1.0-8 (Jun 28, 2013)
  + gseaFingerprint.Rscript does not warn when -sortBy is not specified

Version 1.0-7 (Feb 27, 2013)
  + Add list2mat, transforming first-level lists to adjacency matrix
  + ntpTemplates are updated so that it directly inherits a matrix

Version 1.0-6 (Feb 26, 2013)
  + Add function ntp to implement the Nearest Template Prediction Algorithm
  + Add functions readGmt, gsNames, gsDescs, gsGenes, geneCountFilter, etc. to manipulate GeneSets objects from GMT files
  + Add ntpTemplates and ntpBiTemplates to construct NTP-templates from GeneSets.

Version 1.0-5 (Nov 19, 2012)
  + New feature of gmtIndices: invalid Gene Symbols ("", "-") are removed

Version 1.0-4 (Nov 01, 2012)
  + New function added, mroast2tbl, to reformat result lists of limma::mroast into data frame.
  + New function added, gmtIndices.Rd, to get integer indices of genes in GMT gene set lists from a vector of gene symbols. Used by functions such as 'mroast' and 'camera' in the limma package.
  + New function added, filterGmtByGeneCount, to filter gmt lists by gene counts.
  + Improvement of buildGSEAcomm: CHIP_FILE is no longer a mandatory parameter. When the option is missing, the GSEA tool performs no mapping between rnk-file identifiers and GMT-file identifiers, for instance when both files use official gene symbols.

Version 1.0-3 (Oct 02, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprint is now able to deal with cases where the phenotypes are now named in default as 'pos' and 'neg'. Since in such cases, the order of positive/negative is not clearly defined, we use the alphabetic order of phenotype names as 'pos' and 'neg'.

Version 1.0-2 (Jul 16, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprintMatrix: omit empty directories
  + gseaFingerprintMatrix: stops if all input directories are detected NOT to be GSEA result folders
  + gseaQvalue: q-values is given in -log10(p) instead of -log(p) (base-10) to make interpretation easier
  + Add buildGSEAcomm: build bash commands to run GSEA. Able to deal with irregular file names

Version 1.0-1 (Jun 07, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprints.Rscript: remove empty lines from input file

Version 1.0-0 (Jun 06, 2012)
  + Establish the ribiosGSEA package
  + Refactor GSEA-related functions from other packages
  + Add functions used to extract fingerprints from GSEA results
